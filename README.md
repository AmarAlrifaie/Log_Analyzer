# Java Log Analyzer Application

## Overview
The Java Log Analyzer is a robust tool designed to aggregate and analyze security logs from multiple sources.

## Features
- **Log Merging**: Automatically merges multiple log files into a single collection for analysis.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Supports dynamic filtering to help users isolate specific log records based on attributes like IP address, timestamp, username, and more.
- **Interactive GUI**: Utilizes JavaFX to provide a user-friendly graphical interface for all interactions.
- **Data Persistence**: Offers options to save and load analysis results, allowing for ongoing security monitoring.
- **Custom Sorting**: Users can sort log records based on different fields through an easy-to-use interface.
